## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nl_ticket_filter.git
cd nl_ticket_filter
```
### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Application

### Backend

The backend is developed using `FastAPI` and can be started with `Uvicorn`. It provides the API endpoints for processing queries and retrieving tickets.

To run the backend server, use:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
This command starts the FastAPI server in development mode with auto-reload enabled. The backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Frontend

The frontend is built with Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for inputting natural language queries and viewing results.

To start the Streamlit application, use:
```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

This command launches the Streamlit server, and the frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8501`. 

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the project, use:
```bash
pytest
```
Ensure that you have the `pytest` module installed in your virtual environment.
